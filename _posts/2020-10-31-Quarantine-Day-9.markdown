Holloweeeeeeeen and nothing happened.

I booked a ticket from Qingdao to Beijing on Nov 5th. I and others who started the quarantine with me will be able to check out this hotel and travel to where ever place. But before leaving, I had to provide the information about the destination. Such as the address of the destination, my contact information, and itinerary. If everything goes well, I will be in my apartment in Beijing around dinner time. I have some snacks, so I don't need to order food when I get there. When I get back to my apartment, I will clean things up a little bit and check the movers moved all of my stuff from my old apartment. I hope they didn't forget anything. Then I will have a burger. I really want to have a burger. Maybe I can stop by McDonald's or Burger King.
