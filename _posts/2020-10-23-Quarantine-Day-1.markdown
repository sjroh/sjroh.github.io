Top 'o the Morning' to ya!

The second day in the quarantine facility has been started. My bed was ok and the blanket was warm enough to get me to sleep.

Nothing special, and nothing has been changed except I need to work today. I already clean up the desk for my work. I regret to not bring a keyboard and mouse.

The facility manager or translator told me that I can order snacks, beers, or other foods. So I ordered a local beer, which is Tsingtao beer. There were two types of beer, one manufactured from the first factory and the other manufactured from the second factory. I ordered both to enjoy my Friday night.
