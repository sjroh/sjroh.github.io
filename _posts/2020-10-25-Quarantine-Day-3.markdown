Shiny Sunday with a cotton swab.

After breakfast, the doctor/nurse came to my door to collect samples for the PCR test. Instead of collecting samples from my nose and mouth, she only collected the sample from my mouth. It was a bit tough than the last time. But still, it was better than drill my nose. However, I'm not sure when can I will get the result. When I was in Korea, it took about 7 hours to get the result. After a while, a baby started to cry. Maybe the baby was scared or felt uncomfortable with that doctor/nurse and collecting samples.

Today's meals followed the pattern I found. The good thing is every meal has some protein in it. I finished the second bottle of Tsingtao beer that I bought last Friday. I prefer the one from the first factory. The one from the first factory has more bitterness than the one from the second factory.
