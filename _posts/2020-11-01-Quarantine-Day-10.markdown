Last Sunday of my quarantine.

Every meal, the facility provides me a pair of disposable wooden chopsticks, a plastic spoon, a napkin, and a toothpick. Today's fail was a pair of chopsticks. I had to break the chopsticks (not sure break would be a proper word for this) to use. Somehow I failed, I couldn't break them but I partially detached them from one to another. The reason I said 'partially' because they are not fully separated.

Since I'm in China, I had to recall that I can't use Google or other web services that I used to use because of the Great Firewall of China. So I installed the Edge browser to get familiar with Bing. I do know I can just change the default search engine of safari, but I was too lazy to change that. For me installing another browser would be easier.

The funny thing is the Chinese version of Bing has two search options. One said a domestic version and an international version. When I search for something in English in the domestic version, sometimes I can see the text said the given keyword to search is in English. Also, it suggests me to use the international version. Another difference that I found was the search result. For example, I search for *apple* the domestic version showed me a Chinese Apple website, which is apple.com.cn. But in the international version, Bing showed me *apple.com*, which is a US website.

I opened eight tabs on one window of Edge browser. Then my laptop started to make a sound like an airplane and the browser stopped to react. I checked the Activity Monitor. It showed me that *Microsoft Edge Helper (Renderer)* was taking about 85% of my CPU, and that is not good. Now it's 95% and I don't even using it right now. Based on the name of the processor, it seems like Edge is having trouble with rendering the website. I'm not sure where it stuck. So, I Bing it or should I say Bang it or Binged it? I found two pages that might help me out. I tried the method in the second reference. Let's see how it goes.
