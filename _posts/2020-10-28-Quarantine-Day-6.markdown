I can see some buildings over the window.

AQI of today was quite ok. It was 55. Still, it showed an orange color. I can accept that because this is a city, there should be a lot of vehicles at least. So, 55 is not a bad number. I opened the window and get some kinda fresh air.

I found another meal pattern. Actually, I'm not sure I can call this a pattern because it repeats every 2-3 days. Until now, every 2-3 days, I had dumplings for dinner with an apple. The skin of Chinese dumplings is thicker than Korean dumplings. Somebody told me it's a cultural difference.
