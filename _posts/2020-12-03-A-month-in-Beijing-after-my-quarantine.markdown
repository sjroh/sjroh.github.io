It's been a month since my quarantine in Qingdao. It was a busy month. Not busy as the first time I've arrived in China.

For the first two weeks, I couldn't go back to my office because of the company safety policy. The Chinese government wants me to upload my information to some kind of tracking app named "Health Kit", but I'm still not sure what would do in the background. Based on the items on the screen, I assumed this application will pull the PCR results from somewhere (if possible), track where I've been, and let me sign in to some places by scanning the QR code.

The area I'm living in doesn't seem like changed a lot. Some of the stores on the street has been closed. I can see many people wearing a mask in different variations such as regular way, mouth cover, chin cover, tiny accessory for your hand, or fancy bracelet.

When I left Korea, I packed more than 100 masks in my luggage. The Korean customs service wants me to declare the items. For a second, I wanted to give up the mask because I thought there should be a lot of paperwork. However, it wasn't. Not even a thing that I need to write. One of the customs service officers wrote down something and wanted to check all the masks I packed. After he checked all my masks, he put a fancy sticker that says declared on my luggage.
