# Adding Google Analytics

I opened a Google Analytics account and activated the tracking ID. Based on what I found, I don't need to create a html file for script then implement it. Since I'm using minima theme, it said it supports Google Analytics script in head tag by adding tracking ID in the config file of Jekyll. From now on, I can see there is a visitor or not.

As I recall, 2012 was the last time I checked Google Analytics. I should catch few things up. So that I can use more features of Google Analytics.
