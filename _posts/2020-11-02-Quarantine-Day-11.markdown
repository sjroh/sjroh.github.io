Monday again :)

Air quality was pretty ok in the morning, it was around 60. I had a chance to open the window and fill some fresh air into my room. I didn't realize that I could see more than ten tower cranes from my balcony. Around lunch, it flew to higher than 100. Literally, I cannot see the buildings because of air pollution.
