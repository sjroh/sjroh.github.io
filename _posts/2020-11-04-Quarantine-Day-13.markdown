Last night!

Medical staff knocked on my door. They already took my tissue samples from my mouth a few minutes ago. So I guess they are standing in front of my door to take some of my blood. I put a mask on my face then opened the door. I can see three people who wear white hazmat suits. I gave my left arm to one of them. So she can put a needle on the inside of my elbow. She flipped my arm and pull the hand instead of my elbow. I was a bit surprised because she started to rub something on the back of my hand with her cotton swab. The cotton swab was dyed like a sunset, maybe it's povidone-iodine. She put a needle on one of my veins. Since this was the first time someone put a needle on the back of my hand with or without intention, it wasn't painful as I expected. My blood came out through the needle, like pumping water using an antique water pump.
