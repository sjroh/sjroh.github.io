Another Monday.

It feels like the second week of my quarantine. But it isn't. Time doesn't fly when you are stuck in a hotel room without permission to go outside. It's time to find something for the next weekend.

Around the afternoon, I needed some break. So I moved my body to the balcony and tried to enjoy the sight with some winds. Buildings in my view were covered with light fog. Then I thought, I should check the air quality. It was 157, and it's not a good number to open your windows to get some fresh air.
