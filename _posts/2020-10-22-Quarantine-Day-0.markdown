Landed on Qingdao in the morning. 

Got a swap test through my nose and mouth. Mouth was ok as usual, no pain. But the nose... this was not nice. It’s worse than the last time I took.The nurse/doctor (not sure which one was) drilled both of my nose hole.

After I pick up my luggages, people who are in chemsuit (I call it thin marshmallow suit) guided me to the bus. Every seats were wrapped with plastic bags like a new car. But the smell wasn’t.

On the way to the quarantine place feels like a Qingdao city tour. I wish I can have some time to enjoy the city after my quarantine.

Sunshine through the bus window was warm enough to remind me the walking in the park in the late summer. Not hot but warm enough to wear a t-shirt and shorts to go out. If I wasn’t on the way to quarantine, I would definitely call my friends to go to the park.

After about an hour ride, I arrived the quarantin place. At first, the hotel looks like a place which is being ready to open but based on the current situation, it might just cleaned up for the quarantine.

Based on the given documents in the room, I will get three meals per day. If I want, I could order a food through the room service.
