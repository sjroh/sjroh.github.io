Landed on Qingdao in the morning. 

Got a swap test through my nose and mouth. The mouth was ok as usual, no pain. But the nose... this was not nice. It’s worse than the last time I took. The nurse/doctor (not sure which one was) drilled both of my nose holes.

After I pick up my luggage, people who are in chemsuit (I call it thin marshmallow suit) guided me to the bus. Every seat was wrapped with plastic bags like a new car. But the smell wasn’t.

On the way to the quarantine, it feels like a Qingdao city tour. I wish I can have some time to enjoy the city after my quarantine.

Sunshine through the bus window was warm enough to remind me of walking in the park in the late summer. Not hot but warm enough to wear a t-shirt and shorts to go out. If I wasn’t on the way to quarantine, I would call my friends to go to the park.

After an hour-long bus ride, I arrived at the quarantine place. At first, the hotel looks like a place that is being ready to open but based on the current situation, it might just be cleaned up for the quarantine.

Based on the given documents in the room, I will get three meals per day. If I want, I could order food through the room service.
