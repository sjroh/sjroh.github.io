Dumpling day!

I kinda missed dumplings. It's because it's easy to eat and easy to clean. I have two more nights to stay in this place. Thursday (check out day) would be a lot busier than the last few days. Packing, checking out, take a train, and take a subway to my apartment. I'm expecting more than six hours of travel. I hope I can find something interesting while I'm traveling to Beijing.
