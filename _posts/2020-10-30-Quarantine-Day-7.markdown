Halfway done!

I've got a bag of snacks from the Korean Community in Qingdao or should I say Qingdao Korean Association? It was a very thoughtful gift. One of the group chat for the quarantine passed the words of appreciation to the community.

Since I can check out the room at 9 AM on Nov 5th, I only need six and a half days to go includes weekends. I thought that check out the room at 9 AM was a bit odd time. The translator said it's because my flight landed in Qingdao at 9 AM.
